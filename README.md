# Applitools Holiday Shopping Hackathon

Your imaginary retail company, Applifashion is preparing for a busy holiday season – in fact they are predicting that they will have record traffic for both Black Friday & Cyber Monday – with this year’s biggest sellers predicted to be the new “cozy quarantine slippers”.

The Applifashion team has been hard at work implementing some updates, and you have been tasked with ensuring that the responsive web application looks and functions as designed across all screens.

### Project information

This project uses the new Microsoft Edge browser. In order for this to work you need to set the path to the webdriver binary in the test.properties file in the src/test/resources folder.  
You also need to set in the same file your Applitools api key to connect to the Eyes SDK.
